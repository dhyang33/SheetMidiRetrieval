# SheetMidiRetrieval

This repository contains the code for our ISMIR 2019 paper "MIDI Passage Retrieval Using Cell Phone Pictures of 
Sheet Music."

The goal of this system is to retrieve a specific passage of music from a MIDI file by taking a cell phone picture of a 
physical page of the sheet music.

You can find the paper and dataset [here](http://pages.hmc.edu/ttsai).

## Installation

After cloning this repository, you will also need to download and unzip the dataset into the project directory.
After that, you can simply run the jupyter notebooks in order.
